**Class registration required for attendance**. Students may attend only those classes for which they have registered. Faculty may not add students to class rosters or Blackboard. Therefore, if students are attending a class for which they have not registered, they must stop attending.

**Honor System: upholding academic integrity**. Students must use the VCU Honor Pledge when handing in any take home work. Please refer to the VCU Honor System at [https://students.vcu.edu/studentconduct/vcu-honor-system/academic-misconduct-/honor-pledge/](https://students.vcu.edu/studentconduct/vcu-honor-system/academic-misconduct-/honor-pledge/). The Honor System Pledge is “On my honor, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment, and I pledge that I am in compliance with the VCU Honor System.”

The VCU Honor System policy describes the responsibilities of students, faculty and administration in upholding academic integrity, while at the same time respecting the rights of individuals to the due process offered by administrative hearings and appeals. According to this policy, “Members of the academic community are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity.” In addition, “All members of the VCU community are presumed to have an understanding of the VCU Honor System and are required to:

* Agree to be bound by the Honor System policy and its procedures;Report suspicion or knowledge of possible violations of the Honor System;
* Support an environment that reflects a commitment to academic integrity;
* Answer truthfully when called upon to do so regarding Honor System cases, and,
* Maintain confidentiality regarding specific information in Honor System cases.

More information can be found at in the VCU policy library (http://www.policy.vcu.edu) under the *Education and Student Life* tab.

**Important dates**. You can view important dates for the semester in the academic calendar at [http://academiccalendars.vcu.edu](http://academiccalendars.vcu.edu).

**Mandatory responsibility of faculty members to report incidents of sexual misconduct**. It is important for students to know that all faculty members are mandated reporters of any incidents of sexual misconduct/violence (e.g., sexual assault, sexual exploitation and partner or relationship violence). This means that faculty cannot keep information about sexual misconduct/violence confidential if you share that information with them and they must report this in- formation immediately to the university’s Title IX Coordinator. In addition, department chairs, deans, and other unit administrators are required to report incidents of sex or gender-based discrimination to the university’s Title IX Coordinator.

Confidential reporting sources include staff in Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence at the Wellness Resource Center, University Counseling Services and University Student Health Services. The Policy on Sexual Misconduct/Violence and Sex/Gender Discrimination - Interim, can be found in the VCU Policy Library (see http://www.policy.vcu.edu).

**Military short-term training or deployment**. If military students receive orders for short-term training or for deployment/mobilization, they should inform and present their orders to Military Student Services and to their professor(s). For further information on policies and procedures contact Military Student Services at 828-5993 or access the corresponding policies.

**Student Conduct in the Classroom**. According to the Faculty Guide to Student Conduct in Instructional Settings ([http://www.policy.vcu.edu/sites/default/files/Faculty%20Guide%20to%20Student%20Conduct%20in%20Instructional%20Settings.pdf](http://www.policy.vcu.edu/sites/default/files/Faculty%20Guide%20to%20Student%20Conduct%20in%20Instructional%20Settings.pdf)), “The university is a community of learners. Students, as well as faculty, have a responsibility for creating and maintaining an environment that supports effective instruction. In order for faculty members (including graduate teaching assistants) to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, studios, online courses, and other learning areas, the university expects students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner.” Among other things, cell phones should be turned off while in the classroom. The Student Code of Conduct also prohibits the possession of or carrying of any weapon. For more information, see [http://register.dls.virginia.gov/details.aspx?id=3436](http://register.dls.virginia.gov/details.aspx?id=3436).

**Student email policy**. Email is considered an official method for communication at VCU because it delivers information in a convenient, timely, cost-effective, and environmentally aware manner. Students are expected to check their official VCU email on a frequent and consistent basis in order to remain informed of university-related communications. The university recommends checking email daily. Students are responsible for the consequences of not reading, in a timely fashion, university-related communications sent to their official VCU student email account. This policy ensures that all students have access to this important form of communication. It ensures students can be reached through a standardized channel by faculty and other staff of the university as needed. Mail sent to the VCU email address may include notification of university-related actions, including disciplinary action. Please read the policy in its entirety visit [http://www.policy.vcu.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Email%20Policy_0.pdf](http://www.policy.vcu.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Email%20Policy_0.pdf).

**Student financial responsibility**. Students assume the responsibility of full payment of tuition and fees generated from their registration and all charges for housing and dining services, and other applicable miscellaneous charges. Students are ultimately responsible for any unpaid balance on their account as a result of the University Financial Aid Office or their third party sponsor canceling or reducing their award(s).

**Students representing the university - excused absences**. Students who represent the university (athletes and others) do not choose their schedules. Student athletes are required to attend games and/or meets. All student athletes should provide their schedules to their instructors at the beginning of the semester. The Intercollegiate Athletic Council strongly encourages faculty to treat missed classes or exams (because of a scheduling conflict) as excused absences and urges faculty to work with the students to make up the work or exam.

**Students with Disabilities**. SECTION 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended require that VCU provides “academic adjustments” or “reasonable accommodations” to any student who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. To receive accommodations, students must request them by contacting the Disability Support Services Office on the Monroe Park Campus (828-2253) or the Division for Academic Success on the MCV campus (828-9782). Please also visit the Disability Support Services webpage: [http://www.students.vcu.edu/dss/](http://www.students.vcu.edu/dss/) or the Division for Academic Success webpage at [http://das.vcu.edu](http://das.vcu.edu).
 
Once students have completed the DSS registration process, they should schedule a meeting with their instructor (s) and provide their instructor (s) with an official DSS accommodation letter. Accommodation letters will outline the required classroom accommodations. Additionally, if coursework requires the student to work in a lab environment, the student should advise the instructor or a department chairperson of any concerns that the student may have regarding safety issues related to a disability. Students should follow this procedure for all courses in the academic semester.

**VCU Mobile**. The VCU Mobile application is a valuable tool to get the latest VCU information on the go. The application contains helpful information including the VCU directory, events, course schedules, campus maps, athletics and general VCU news, emergency information, library resources, Blackboard and more. To download the application on your smart phone or for more information, please visit [http://m.vcu.edu](http://m.vcu.edu).

**Withdrawal from Classes**. Before withdrawing from classes, students should consult their instructor as well as other appropriate university offices. Withdrawing from classes may negatively impact a student’s financial aid award and his or her semester charges. To discuss financial aid and the student bill, visit the Student Services Center (http://ssc.vcu.edu) at 1015 Floyd Avenue (Harris Hall) and/or contact your financial aid counselor regarding the impact on your financial aid.
