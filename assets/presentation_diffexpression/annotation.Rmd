## Gene identifiers

**Gene**

- **Ensembl** ENSG00000139618
- **Entrez** Gene 675
- **Unigene** Hs.34012

**RNA transcript**

- **GenBank** BC026160.1
- **RefSeq** NM_000059
- **Ensembl** ENST00000380152

## ID cross-mapping

- There are many IDs
- Software tools recognize only a handful
- Humans better recognize gene names

## ID challenges

- Avoid errors: map IDs correctly
    - Beware of 1-to-many mappings
- Gene name ambiguity â€“ not a good ID
    - e.g. FLJ92943, LFS1, TRP53, p53
    - Better to use the standard gene symbol, not aliases: TP53
- Excel error-introduction
    - OCT4 is changed to October-4  (open file/paste as text)
- Problems reaching 100% cross-mapping
    - E.g. due to version issues
    - Use multiple sources to increase coverage

## BiomaRt

## BiomaRt

The `getBM()` function has three arguments that need to be introduced: `filters`, `attributes` and `values`. 

- `Filters` define a restriction on the query. Tell BiomaRt what kind of IDs do you have, so it will look for it. The `listFilters()` function shows you all available filters in the selected dataset.
- `Attributes` define the values we are interested in to retrieve. Which IDs associated with your IDs you want to get. The `listAttributes()` function displays all available attributes in the selected dataset.
- `Values` is a vector of IDs you want to convert

## BiomaRt gotchas

- `host` is the database version. For gene ID conversion, use the latest database.

For genomic coordinates, use database that corresponds to genome assembly version you are interested in 

## Other options

Annotation data as R dataframes

R data package for annotating/converting Gene IDs 

- `annotables` R package by Stephen Turner, https://github.com/stephenturner/annotables
